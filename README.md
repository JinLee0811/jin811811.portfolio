# 🌟 My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to showcase my skills and passion for web development. I built this website using cutting-edge technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The entire process, from design to deployment, was a challenging yet rewarding experience.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Built with TypeScript**: Leveraged TypeScript for type safety and enhanced code maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Used Tailwind CSS for efficient and customizable styling, achieving a modern and clean look.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

- **React**: My go-to library for building dynamic and interactive UIs.
- **TypeScript**: Added robustness to my JavaScript code with static type definitions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed utility-first CSS for rapid styling.
- **Next.js**: Utilized Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- **Prisma**: Integrated Prisma for seamless database management.

## ✨ Contributions

This project was a solo endeavor, and I was responsible for all aspects of development:

- **Frontend Development**: Designed and implemented the user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Design and Styling**: Crafted a visually appealing and modern design, focusing on usability and aesthetics.
- **Backend Integration**: Set up the backend with Next.js and Prisma to handle server-side rendering and database interactions.

## 💻 Issue Management and Reflections

Throughout the project, I encountered and overcame several challenges:

- **Layout Issues**: Faced challenges with maintaining a consistent layout across different screen sizes, primarily due to monitor resolution differences. I resolved these by extensively testing and adjusting the CSS.
- **TypeScript Management**: Managing TypeScript types and error correction was a steep learning curve, but it significantly improved the quality of my code.
- **Tailwind CSS Customization**: Customizing Tailwind CSS to fit my design vision was tricky, but it paid off in the end with a clean and cohesive UI.
- **Time Constraints**: I managed to complete the website within a tight deadline, which required effective time management and prioritization of tasks.
