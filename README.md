# üåü My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to showcase my skills and passion for web development. I built this website using cutting-edge technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The entire process, from design to deployment, was a challenging yet rewarding experience.

## üìå Key Features

- **Built with TypeScript**: Leveraged TypeScript for type safety and enhanced code maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Used Tailwind CSS for efficient and customizable styling, achieving a modern and clean look.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

- **React**: My go-to library for building dynamic and interactive UIs.
- **TypeScript**: Added robustness to my JavaScript code with static type definitions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed utility-first CSS for rapid styling.
- **Next.js**: Utilized Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- **Prisma**: Integrated Prisma for seamless database management.

## ‚ú® Contributions

This project was a solo endeavor, and I was responsible for all aspects of development:

- **Frontend Development**: Designed and implemented the user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Design and Styling**: Crafted a visually appealing and modern design, focusing on usability and aesthetics.
- **Backend Integration**: Set up the backend with Next.js and Prisma to handle server-side rendering and database interactions.

## üíª Issue Management and Reflections

Throughout the project, I encountered and overcame several challenges:

- **Layout Issues**: Faced challenges with maintaining a consistent layout across different screen sizes, primarily due to monitor resolution differences. I resolved these by extensively testing and adjusting the CSS.
- **TypeScript Management**: Managing TypeScript types and error correction was a steep learning curve, but it significantly improved the quality of my code.
- **Tailwind CSS Customization**: Customizing Tailwind CSS to fit my design vision was tricky, but it paid off in the end with a clean and cohesive UI.
- **Time Constraints**: I managed to complete the website within a tight deadline, which required effective time management and prioritization of tasks.

## üöÄ Deployment

The portfolio is live and accessible at [https://jin-lee-portfolio.vercel.app/](https://jin-lee-portfolio.vercel.app/). It was deployed using Vercel, allowing for continuous integration and smooth updates.

## üéØ Final Thoughts

Building this portfolio has been an incredible journey of growth and learning. I'm proud of the outcome and excited to continue improving and expanding my skill set. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!
